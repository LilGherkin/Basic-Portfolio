    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" class="ProfilePic">
    <p>Hello, my name is Mark. This is my page. A little bit about me I suppose. I did Stand Up comedy in the Minneapolis area for about 6 months, and was once told by a better known comedian that I reminded him of Louis C.K. 1 week later he announced that he had been jerking off in front of women, and I could only think "How did he know I did that too?"</p>
    <br>
    <p>Otherwise, I also do 3D modeling utilizing Blender, and occassionaly do work with Habitat for Humanity. I don't get a sense of joy out of building the houses for lesser off families. I just get joy out of building a house, regardless of who lives in it. Ted Bundy could live in it, and I wouldn't care, nor remember that I helped build it.</p>
